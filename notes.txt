Put the markdowns in the markdowns folder

These markdowns will be embedded in your pgVector db
Each markdown will be hashed and added to processed_files.txt.
On each run, the markdowns are hashed again and any that have changed are re-embedded.

Delete processed_files.txt, and delete the table in pGAdmin, to re embed afresh.
