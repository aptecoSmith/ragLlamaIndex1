# Orbit Search

Searching for customer attributes (variables) is fundamental in using both Audiences and Dashboards in Orbit to find those people you wish to target or take a more focused look in visualisations to describe behavioural patterns or transactional trends.  

The Search function in Orbit has been enhanced to ensure finding those attributes or variables is quick and efficient. You may have many data variables which sound the same but maybe formatted differently e.g. text or numeric.  Symbols describing the variable type have been added so that you can be sure of selecting the data in the correct format for your needs. 

We have gone further to improve the default Search mechanism, by filtering the Search to show data variable names relating to the search criteria, not all options within each data variable as well. If you prefer the old way of showing you everything then you can always tick that box to expand the search.

We have also combined searching and browsing together so that you don't have to switch between the two modes to understand where the data has come from. For example you may have many data variables relating to Sales in your data: Sales from different product divisions, sales from different channels or sales from different brands - now by showing the data in folders, you can be reassured you are choosing the correct variable for your needs. For functions such as adding Measures to a Dashboard tile or applying Limits, the new Search will allow you to select the table name rather than having to search for it. 

Search has not only been enhanced for efficiency but will soon be evolving to allow you to search and select not only saved Audiences but also URN files and Selections which have been made and saved in Apteco FastStats for use in Audiences and Dashboards in the Apteco Orbit platform.
