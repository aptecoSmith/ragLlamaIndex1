# Working with single choice values: Selectors

Selectors are single choice answers. For example, a person with a single Income Band, is denoted by a single tick. The values you choose here filter your audience to only include or exclude records (People, Companies, Transactions etc.) that have this characteristic. 

You can choose to include or exclude via **Income**:

Each record in the data can have only one matching value in this type of characteristic, so you can filter to include records that have any of the values you choose, or none of the values.

You can choose the values in your filter from the pick list, or upload a file to match against.

The values that you have chosen are displayed in your audience. You can edit these values, or delete the whole section:
