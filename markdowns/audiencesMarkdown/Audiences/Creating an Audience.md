# Creating an Audience

**Including and excluding characteristics**

You can define your audience by including and excluding characteristics, also known as variables. For example, you may include your high value customers but exclude people who have recently made a purchase, or have opted out of communication. 

You can access sections for includes and excludes only via the **Audience** tab:


Using the Add Filter button within either the Include or Exclude sectio (but usually the Include), you can choose to build sections of your audience and define how the characteristics are combined.

You do this by clicking on 'Add Filter' then using the Orbit search UI to navigate to the desired variable.  Once you have selected the desired variable, you will see the categories within it available to you for filtering.
For example on the Bookings table there is a variable called Destination.  Clicking on Destination will show a list of possible destinations.

Once some selection criteria have been applied, you will see the count of records highlighted in blue underneath the audience name, along with a percentage figure.  This figure is the number of found records compared to your overall database count of records.
You can limit the audience size by using the 'Apply Limits' button.
