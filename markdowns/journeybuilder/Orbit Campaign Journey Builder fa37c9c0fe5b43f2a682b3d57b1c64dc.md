# Orbit Campaign Journey Builder

[Introducing the Orbit Journey Builder](https://www.notion.so/Introducing-the-Orbit-Journey-Builder-0c38716a92014c08b2a8293a8d1427ab?pvs=21)

You can plan and execute campaign journeys via Orbit. Starting with the ability to create single stage campaigns (one target segment, one message), you can use Orbit audiences to decide on who to include and exclude in your target segment. 

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Note**: Orbit supports different channel outputs, allowing you to utilise FTP, file, or email channels to communicate your message.

</aside>

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Note**: If you are also using Apteco PeopleStage for your more complex campaigning needs, then Orbit also displays your PeopleStage campaigns to help you monitor them. If your PeopleStage campaigns are compatible with the functionality in Orbit, you can then edit them in the platform. All campaigns built in Orbit can also be accessed, edited, and republished via PeopleStage.

</aside>

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Note**: To use journey builder, you must have the Apteco Broadcaster license or above, and at least the Q1 2023 of Apteco software installed to use percentage limits functionality.

</aside>

## Working with campaigns in Orbit

The campaigns tab in Orbit allows you to see all of your campaign journeys you have set up in Orbit and PeopleStage. Each tile is a campaign summarising the campaign status. This status includes when the campaign was last run, its schedule information, and which communication channels are in use.

![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled.png)

### Filtering and searching for campaigns

You can filter campaigns using the filter and search panel, to the left of the campaign tab. 

Campaigns can be filtered based on their status, first run date, last run date, and next run date. 

To filter a campaign:

1. Use the radio buttons to choose which status you wish to use as a filter.
2. Use the drop down menus underneath the run frequencies to filter the campaigns.

To search for a campaign:

1. Type the name of the campaign. The number of campaigns on screen reduces until the ones beginning with or containing those words is displayed.
2. Select the relevant campaign(s).

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Info**: You can also tab through the pages of campaigns using the page navigation.

</aside>

### Deleting a campaign

You can delete a campaign from the campaign screen using the ellipses button on each campaign tile. 

![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%201.png)

Once deleted, the campaign is deactivated from recording any further communication history and deleted from campaigns.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Note**: By deleting a campaign in Orbit, you also delete the campaign in PeopleStage.

</aside>

### Viewing a journey

You can view a campaign journey by using the ellipses menu on a campaign tile. The journey is viewed in read only mode or view mode.

![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%202.png)

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Note**: View Journey only displays campaigns that are compatible with the current Orbit journey builder. Campaigns made in PeopleStage may not be currently supported by the journey builder and wonâ€™t appear in this view.

</aside>

## Starting a new campaign journey

To start a new campaign journey:

1. Navigate to the **Campaigns** tab in Orbit.
2. Click **+ Campaign,** in the top-right corner.

![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%203.png)

1. Give your campaign a name, then click **Create.**

![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%204.png)

Orbit then creates a new campaign, launching a journey via the journey tab. This allows you to populate the target audience and communication channel.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Note**: Once you have clicked **Create**, a campaign journey appears and is available for you in edit mode. This allows you to populate each part of the builder. **Save** is available, for saving work throughout the process. If you have finished editing your campaign, then you can click the **Finish Edit** button to move the campaign from edit mode to view mode, allowing other campaigners to also edit the campaign in Orbit or PeopleStage.

</aside>

Your campaign is launched in the journey builder and you are now ready to add who to target and the chosen communication channel.

### Adding an Orbit audience to the exclude section

To add an audience to the excluding section:

1. Click **+ Add Audience** in the exclude section of the panel.
2. Search for and select the required Orbit **Audience**. If you require more than one Orbit audience, use the tick boxes on the left hand side to select the audience you want.

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Info**: In this case, select **Master Exclusion**. This audience is then added to the exclude section of the regular customers target segment.

</aside>

![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2010.png)

Once applied, the current selection count appears. To display gross and nett counts, you must save the journey. 

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Note**: This save is not currently necessary, as we have only applied one audience as an exclusion.

</aside>

The ellipses menu on the audience tile allows you to delete the audience, if no longer required. 

![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2011.png)

You can add further audiences by clicking **+ Add Audience** and repeating the process. 

### Adding an Orbit audience to the including section

To add an audience to an including section:

1. Click **+ Add Audience** in the Including section of the panel. 
2. Search for and select the required Orbit **Audience**. If you require more than one Orbit audience, use the tick boxes on the left hand side to select the audience you want.
    
    ![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2012.png)
    
    <aside>
    ðŸ’¡ **Info**: In this case, select **Seeds** and **Active Customer Base**. These audiences are then added to the including section of the regular customers target segment.
    
    </aside>
    
    ![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2013.png)
    
    Once applied, the selection count as of the time applied appears. For each include segment applied, a gross and net count is displayed. Gross is displayed without saving. However, to get the latest de duped net count, and overall gross and net counts to display, you must save the journey. 
    
    You can add further audiences by clicking **+ Add Audience** and repeating the process. 
    
    The ellipsis menu on the audience tile allows you to add a limit or delete the audience, if no longer required. 
    
3. Once you have added the relevant audiences, click **Apply**.

![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2014.png)

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Info**: The gross count displayed is the total de duped count of individuals that can be targeted.  The net count is the total de deduped count including limits and constraints applied. The net count is your target volume.

</aside>

---

## Applying limits

You can apply a limit at the target segment level or to each individual segments within the target audience. 

### Applying an overall target segment limit

To apply an overall target segment limit:

1. Add a **Target Segment** to the journey builder.
2. Via the option panel, add any required **Including** or **Excluding** audiences.
3. Click the campaign ellipsis menu, then click **Add Limit**.

![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2015.png)

A limit can be applied by specifying a quantity or percentage. Quantity or percentage can be defined via the unit drop down menu.

![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2016.png)

To apply a quantity limit:

1. Enter the **Amount** that you want to limit.
2. Select the frequency of the limit e.g. X amount every run of the campaign, or every day, week, year, etc.

1. In order to see the limit applied, you must **Save** the Journey. After saving, the percentage is displayed at the top of the screen on the journey builder. 

### Applying a limit to an individual audience

To apply a limit to an individual audience:

1. With inclusion audiences applied, select **Add Limit** via the audience ellipses menu.

![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2019.png)

1. Again, a limit can be applied by specifying a quantity or percentage. Quantity or percentage can be defined via the **Unit** drop down menu.
    
    In this case, we are going to apply a quantity limit of **5000** to our active customer base. 
    

![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2020.png)

1. Click the **+** on the campaign journey.

![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2022.png)

1. Choose the **Journey Step** required. In this case, select an **Email** output channel.
    
    ![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2023.png)

    ![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2024.png)
    
2. Give the email stage a name, then click **Create**.

![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2025.png)

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Info**: At this point, the journey builder updates to confirm that the channel has been created, and a settings panel appears on the right side of the screen.

</aside>

![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2026.png)

### Adding channel details

Select the **Channel**, **Message Name** and, if applicable, a **List Name**.

![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2027.png)

## Recording communication history

You have the option to record communication history for your campaign. Not all campaigns need the communication history recording but, if this campaign needs to be included in contact strategy rules, or requires reporting on, then communication history needs to be recorded. Communication history records the individuals contacted, details of the campaign run, and any personalisation added. 

To record communication history, ensure that the **Record Communication History** box is ticked. 

![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2028.png)

## Adding personalisation

Basic personalisation can be added to the output file produced. This can include free text such as voucher codes or campaign codes and a data variable as defined and available in the system. These output fields are appended to the output file and sent when published to the chosen channel. 

### Adding free text

To add free text:

1. Click **Add Content Field** under the personalisation menu option.
    
    ![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2029.png)
    
2. From the drop down add content field menu, select **Text Field**.
    
    ![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2030.png)
    
    In this case, we are going to flag every record in the output file with an **OfferCode** specific to this campaign. The field value is the content of the field, in this case the code itself.
    
    The field name is the column header and in this case the output column is called **OfferCode.**
    
3. Click **Add** to navigate back to the personalisation screen.

![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2031.png)

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Note**: There is a limit of 4000 characters for a text field.

</aside>

### Adding variables

To add a variable:

1. Under personalisation, click **Add Content Field**.
    
    ![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2029.png)

    ![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2032.png)
    
    In this case, we are going to flag every individual with their segmentation value. The field value is the content of the field, in this case the variable holiday segmentation. 
    
3. Click in the **Field Value** to search for the variable that you wish to include as an output column.
    
    ![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2033.png)
    
    The field name is the column header and in this case the output column is called holiday segment.
    
    ![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2034.png)
    
4. Click **Add** to navigate back to the personalisation screen.

![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2035.png)

1. You can change whether you wish to display the codes of the categories within the variable or the description of the categories by using the drop down to the right side of the variable name. 

![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2036.png)

1. Continue to add **Content Fields** as required and when complete, click **Apply**.
    
    <aside>
    ðŸ’¡ **Info**: The journey builder updates to summarise the Email details set.
    
    </aside>
    

### Changing the format of the selected variable

Once the variable has been selected, you have the option to change how the data is presented in the output file. 

1. To change the presentation of the output data for a particular variable, select the **Formatting** option from the action menu next to the variable.

![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2037.png)

1. Variable formatting can be selected via the drop down menu on the screen. The data can be re formatted to be in uppercase, title case, lower case or to remain unformatted. This helps to create uniformity when using the information in any dynamic copy. 

![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2038.png)

1. You can also decide whether to blank any records flagged as **Unclassified**. Record (where particular for that data variable) information that has not been collected is usually by default flagged as â€˜Unclassifiedâ€™, which appears on the output file. 

![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2039.png)

1. Once any changes have been made, click **Apply**.

## Preview and test email

The journey builder can preview your message and send a test email to a recipient for checking or approval. 

To preview and send a test email:

1. Click the **ellipses** on the channel stage and select **Preview and Test Email**.

![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2040.png)

This action loads a Preview email screen where, if the Email Service Provider has allowed it, Orbit can display a preview of the email due to be sent. 

![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2041.png)

1. To send a test email, ensure that the correct email address has been entered, and press **Send Test Email**. This automatically sends the email to the chosen recipient, ensuring that the correct message name has been chosen and all personalised fields have been applied.

![Untitled](Orbit%20Campaign%20Journey%20Builder%20fa37c9c0fe5b43f2a682b3d57b1c64dc/Untitled%2042.png)

1. Content can also be tested by typing attributes into the content menu on the left side of the preview screen. The content is split into:
    - **Channel Content**: Output fields added to the channel when set up by an administrator. These are typically fields which are always required for the email such as email address, or forename.
    - **Personalisation**: Content fields defined within the journey builder. These are typically fields required to satisfy the dynamic content for this specific email message such as segment or campaign code.
2. Overtype the populated default values with values which would aid the testing of dynamic copy in the email message. 
3. Refresh the preview to see the changes reflected in the email preview. 
4. A test email can be resent to see how the attributes appear in the email copy.
5. Close the preview to return back to the journey builder. 

<aside>
ðŸ’¡ **Note**: Your email preview is dependent on the Email Service Provider (ESP) being used. If an ESP is unsupported, a message is displayed stating that we may not be able to gather and display a preview.

</aside>

## Setting a campaign schedule

You must set a schedule to commence the campaign. 

1. Click **Edit Schedule** at the top of the campaign screen.
