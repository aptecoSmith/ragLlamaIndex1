# Limiting an audience

You may wish to limit your audience to a specific number of records. For example, you may wish to export only a thousand records from your audience. You can choose to ‘Apply Limits’:

When choosing a limit, you can sample the data or use an ‘N Per’.

To sample the data you can choose ‘Top’, ‘Bottom’ or ‘Random’. You will need to provide a characteristic with ‘Top’ and ‘Bottom’ to order by. One example would be the top 100 records by ‘Mean Cost of all Bookings. Using a random limit does not require an order.

To limit your audience to a specific number of records per characteristic, like ten households per region or ten people per household use the ‘N Per’ section. You can pick records per characteristic like this:

And depending on your data, you can choose to filter to a number of records per parent in the data like this
