These are the only Tabs on the global header.

The Audiences button on the global header will take you initially to the List of Audiences.

On this screen is a list of already existing audiences in date created order.
There is a blue 'New Audience' button on the top right.

On the top left is a search text box to search for an audience.
Underneath this is a filter panel with options to filter the viewed audience list.

If you click the 'New Audience' button you will be prompted to name your new audience.  Once entered and you click 'Create', you will be taken to your new audience.

An Orbit Audience is a collection of tabs intended to allow a marketing user to construct and analyse an audience of potential recipients to some marketing material.

It has a tab based interface.  When first created the only tab is the 'Audience' tab and it is named 'Audience'.  This is the tab on which you will find the Include and Exclude sections.
Next to the tab title you will see there is another tab that is currently disabled, with the text 'Add New' as its title.
There are no other tabs until one is added.

Once you have added some selection criteria, the 'Add new' tab is enabled.  Clicking it will show a number of options for you to specify for this new tab:
Solutions - 
Check My results - a tab that can show some charts and a table that further details the distribution of your selected records.
Browse Data - A Data grid with configurable columns to allow you to explore related attributes of the data.
Export Data - Options to export your records either via download in multiple formats, upload to an ftp site, or pass this audience to a campaign to send out emails or other channels.
Find Look-alikes - Find more potential records based on the properties of your current audience.
