The datagrid page is comprised of a grid of data. You can view this data as multiple rows of data or single records on a page. The data can be exported to a file for download, but if you are exporting to a channel or via File Transfer Protocol (FTP), then use the Export Data solution instead.

To Use the Export Data solution:

1. Click the **Add** button on the Export Data tile.
2. Select the Columns for display.
3. Click **Next**.

Once completed, you gain access to a new browse tab with a grid populated with the first thousand records in the data that you have chosen. You can navigate through the data using the pager at the bottom of the grid.
