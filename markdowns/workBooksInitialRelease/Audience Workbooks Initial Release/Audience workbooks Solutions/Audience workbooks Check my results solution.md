# Audience workbooks: Check my results solution

This solution guides you through creating a set of visualisations. These visualisations are used to sense check that the records in the audience are as expected.

What is a check solution?
A check solution is a workbook tab option that can display both charts and a grid to help you visualize the attributes of the selected records in your audience.

Auto generated items typically use the variables you used in your audience.
For each variable used, Orbit will generate a suitable chart that displays the categories within the variable.  For example, if in your audience you had selected records based on the category 'Apple' on the 'Fruit' variable, then Orbit would likely create a chart ( a column chart for example), with only the Apple column populated.
Similarly on the Grid, you would see a column for each records Unique Reference Number (URN) , and also a column with the Header 'Fruit'  Each row should be populated with the category 'Apple', as this is what you selected for on the audience.
